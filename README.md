# Cardiotocography
Predicting the Fetal Status (Normal/Susceptible/Pathologic) using Cardiotocograph Data


Fetal status defined as (Normal/Suspect/ Pathologic) - Itâ€™s a Categorical prediction with Nominal in nature

Methodology Used:

1. Stepwise Regression using StepAIC to reduce the no. of independent variable

2. Multinomial Logistic Regression - Which helps to predict nominal output variables

3. Decision Tree Using rpart & Validation using test dataset & used Party package to improvise the visualization of tree

4. Bagging & Random Forest Approach to improve the model
